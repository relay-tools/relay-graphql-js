# relay-graphql-js

Relay compatible tooling based on `graphql-js`

- [`@relay-graphql-js/graphql-config`](packages/graphql-config/) - a compatibility layer to use relay with `graphql-config` and thus `vscode-graphql` and other tools that use `graphql-config`
- [`vscode-apollo-relay`](packages/vscode-apollo-relay/) - a relay-enabled compatibility layer for `vscode-apollo` and other tools which use `apollo-config`

These compatibility layers ares all built on `@relay-graphql-js/validation-rules`, the retirement home of the legacy [`graphql-js`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) compatible validation rules
